# prolingua-web
A web server and client to allow prolingua compilation over the web

To install on Windows simply run the included `prolingua-init.bat` file. The server is only currently supported on Windows but for stupid reasons I'll hopefully fix soon.
Then to run the server, navigate the the base directory and run the command  `node server.js`.

This server requires node.js, Java 8 and Gradle to run. This server is far from secure enough to be deployed to the web in its current state but with some work. 

See my other repository at www.github.com/doms3/prolingua for details on the original prolingua project.
